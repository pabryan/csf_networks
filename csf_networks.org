A /closed, embedded network of smooth curves with triple-junctions/ is a union of unbounded smooth, embedded curves $(L_i: [0, \infty))_{i=1}^n$ and a piecewise smooth curve $\gamma$ with $n$ nodes, written $\gamma = (\gamma_i : [0,1] \to \RR^2)_{i=1}^n$ with each $\gamma_i$ a smooth embeddings, such that
1. $\gamma_i(0,1) \cap \gamma_j(0,1) = \emptyset$, $i\ne j$,
2. $\gamma_i(1) = \gamma_{i+1}(0)$ with $i$ taken modulo $n$,
3. $L_i(0) = \gamma_i(0)$,
4. $L_i(0,\infty) \subset \cmplt{\Omega}$ with $\Omega$ the closed region enclosed by $\gamma$, 
5. The angle between $\gamma_i'(1)$ and $\gamma_{i+1}'(0)$ equals the angle between $\gamma_{i+1}'(0)$ and $L_{i+1}'(0)$ equals $2\pi/3$ (/tri-angle condition/).
Each point $\gamma_i(0)$ is called a /node/.

#+BEGIN_DEFN
A smooth, one-parameter family $(L_t = (L_i)_t, \gamma_t = ((\gamma_i)_t))$ of closed, embedded networks of smooth curves evolves by /curve shortening/ if for each $i$ and for all $t\in(0,1)$,
\begin{align*}
\left(\pd[\gamma_i]{t}\right)^{\perp} &= -\curvecurv \\
\intertext{and}
\left(\pd[L_i]{t}\right)^{\perp} &= -\curvecurv
\end{align*}
where for a vector field $X$ along a curve, $X^{\perp} = \ip{X}{\nor}$ denotes the normal component of $X$ with $\nor$ the unit outer normal and $\curvecurv$ the curvature of the curve.

For $\alpha = L_i, \gamma_i$, write
\[
\pd[\alpha_i]{t} = (\tangspeed \tang - \curvecurv \nor)_{\alpha_i}.
\]
The requirement that $(L_t, \gamma_t)$ remains a closed, embedded network requires that 
\begin{align*}
(\tangspeed \tang - \curvecurv \nor)_{\gamma_i} (1) &= (\tangspeed \tang - \curvecurv \nor)_{\gamma_{i+1}}(0) \\
\intertext{and}
(\tangspeed \tang - \curvecurv \nor)_{L_i} (0) &= (\tangspeed \tang - \curvecurv \nor)_{\gamma_i}(0).
\end{align*}
The tri-angle condition then imposes the adittional condition that for each $i$,

#+BEGIN_REM
Of particular interest is the case where each $L_i$ is a half-line. In this case, since $\curvecurv = 0$ along $L_i$, the nodes are constrained to move along the line through $L_i$.
